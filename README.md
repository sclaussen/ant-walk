This is the solution to a MOEMS "M" middle school math problem.
Here's the problem:

An Ant begins at point B below (the beginning) and must walk up the
ladder to point E (the end) by traversing the vertical and/or
horizontal lines.  The ant can go up or across, but not down, nor can
it retrace its steps.  How many different ways can the ant ascend the
ladder?

```
11--E--12
 |     |
 9-----10
 |     |
 7-----8
 |     |
 5-----6
 |     |
 3-----4
 |     |
 1-----2
 |     |
 +--B--+
```
