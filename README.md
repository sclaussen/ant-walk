This is the solution to a MOEMS "M" middle school math problem.
Here's the problem:

In the diagram below, an ant begins at point B (the beginning) and
must walk up the ladder to point E (the end) by traversing the
vertical and/or horizontal lines.  The ant can go up or across, but
not down, nor can it retrace its steps.  How many different ways can
the ant ascend the ladder?

```
11--E--12
 |     |
 9-----10
 |     |
 7-----8
 |     |
 5-----6
 |     |
 3-----4
 |     |
 1--B--2
```
